## Objectives

- Make computing more ubiquitous onboard vessels
- Standardize formats to enable insight across a fleet
- Be able to continuously deploy software and new workloads to vessels

## Core principles

- Open source
- Standardization
- Secure by default - zero-trust environment
- Avoid design by committee through clear responsibilities and core principles
- Privacy: Your data is your own - data-owners should consent to usage and be able to see who can see their data
- "Walled garden" principle - control allocation of resources to avoid noisy neighbors and (Quotas)
- Focus on service level agreements
- Built on a modern software and hardware stack
- Limit the surface area to create a predictable platform (Linux, Docker, Kubernetes - no VMs and Windows)
- Connectivity is scarce and costly - QOS and prioritization needs to be on a shipOS level
- Should be easy to use; think mobile app-stores for purchasing apps and capabilities
