ShipOS consists of both hardware and software that work together to
bring forward the innovation necessary to bring shipping to the future.
Core to ShipOS is that everything is built in the open, complete open-source
and is a joint effort across the industry governed by a foundation.

More information will come on this page as we gather the foundation and establish
its core members.
